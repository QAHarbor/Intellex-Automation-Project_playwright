# IntellEx Academic Testing Framework

## Overview
This project uses **Playwright** for running end-to-end tests on the **IntellEx Academic platform**. The framework ensures the platform functions as expected across different environments.

## 🛠️ Environment Setup

### 1. Check Node.js Installation
Ensure **Node.js** is installed:
```bash
node -v
```
If not installed, download it from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### 2. Clone the Repository and Install Dependencies
Clone the project and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
npm install
npm playwright install
```



### 3. Install Allure Commandline (Optional)
To generate Allure reports, install the Allure command line:
```bash
npm install -g allure-commandline --save-dev
npm install allure-playwright --save-dev
```

---

## 🚀 Running Tests

### 1. Run All Tests
To run all test cases across the entire project, simply use:
```bash
npx playwright test
```
This will execute all tests defined in the project, running through each test suite in the repository.

### 2. Run a Specific Test Suite
To run a specific test suite (e.g., `HomePage.spec.js`), use:
```bash
npx playwright test HomePage.spec.js
```
This command runs only the `HomePage.spec.js` test suite, so you can isolate specific tests for debugging or specific testing needs.

### 3. View HTML Test Report
To generate and view the HTML report after running tests:
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## 📊 Generating Allure Reports

### 1. Run Tests with Allure Reporter

```bash
npx playwright test --reporter=allure-playwright

### Key Updates:
- **Run All Tests**: Use `npx playwright test` to run **all** test suites in the project.
- **Run Specific Test Suite**: Use `npx playwright test HomePage.spec.js` to run a **specific test suite** (for example, `HomePage.spec.js`).
- **Simplified Flow**: The instructions are streamlined for easier understanding, with the most essential commands for running tests and viewing reports.

This structure should now clearly differentiate between running all tests and running a specific test suite. Let me know if this works or if you'd like any further modifications!
